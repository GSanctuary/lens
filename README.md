## About

Sanctuary is a lens for Snap's Spectacles that transforms the world around you with an extensive widget library. By leveraging the power of space, Sanctuary enables you to have information tied to a particular location, whether it's your room, kitchen, office, garage, etc. We give you _exactly_ what you need, _precisely_ where you need it.

## Features

-   **Extensive Widget Library**. Our widgets enable you to uniquely interact with the world through AR, giving you ways to capture the information you need at a particular location.
-   **Space memory** (coming soon). Each widget is associated with a particular set of spaces, and pops up exactly where you left it.
-   **Social interaction** (coming soon). Sanctuary plans on including various ways to interact with others through our Lens, such as sharing spaces, creating custom widgets, and more. Stay tuned for more info!
